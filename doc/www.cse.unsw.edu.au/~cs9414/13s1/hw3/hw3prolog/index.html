<h4>Introduction</h4>

In this assignment, you will implement the basic functions of a simple
BDI Agent that operates in a Gridworld, and by doing so, learn about
the ideas underlying BDI agents.

<h4>Gridworld</h4>

The Gridworld consists of a two-dimensional grid of locations,
extending to infinity in both directions. Some locations contain
"junk" which the agent must "clean up" in order to score points. An
agent cleans up a piece of junk by moving to its location and
executing a pickup action. Agents can move one square at a time either
horizontally or vertically. The world is dynamic in that junk may
spontaneously appear at randomly determined locations at any time,
though there is never more than one item of junk in the same location.

<p>
A supplied Prolog program implements a system for conducting an
experimental trial consisting of one agent in the Gridworld that
repeatedly executes the BDI interpretation cycle for 20 iterations
(this is a deliberately small number for ease of writing and debugging
the program). The initial state of the world is always that there is
no junk and the agent is at the location (0,0).
<p>
The agent's <i>beliefs</i> at any time simply consist of a list containing
one term of the form <code>at(X,Y)</code> representing the current location of the
agent. The agent's beliefs are always correct (i.e. if the agent
"thinks" it is at location (3,4) then it is at location (3,4)). Hence
the initial belief state of the agent is represented by the list
<code>[at(0,0)]</code>.
<p>
The agent's <i>goals</i> at any time are a list of locations of junk and
their values. Each goal of the agent is represented as a term
<code>goal(X,Y,S)</code>, where (X,Y) is the location of a piece of junk and S
is its value. The agent's <i>intentions</i> are a list of pairs, each of the
form <code>[Goal, Plan]</code>, representing a goal with an associated plan (that
may be the empty plan), ordered according to some priority.
<p>
Each plan is a list of actions. To fulfil an intention, the agent
executes the plan associated with the goal, which will make the agent
move along a path towards the goal and clean it up. If, when the agent
chooses a goal to pursue, the plan associated with the goal is empty
or cannot be executed, the agent creates a new plan for the goal and
then begins to execute this plan.
<p>
In each cycle the agent executes one action; there are two types
of action the agent can execute:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>pickup(X,Y)</code> - the agent picks up the junk at (X,Y) and scores the associated points<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>move(X,Y)</code> &nbsp; - &nbsp; the agent moves to the location (X,Y)
<p>
<h4>BDI Interpreter</h4>
<p>

In each time cycle, the agent executes the interpreter shown
abstractly in Figure 2.
The new external events on each cycle
are represented as a list of terms of the form <code>junk(X,Y,S)</code>,
indicating the perception of junk at location (X,Y) with value S within some
viewing distance of the agent. The agent will repeatedly perceive the
same junk item for as long as it is in viewing range. It is not
assumed that the agent can see all of the grid, so a new external
event may occur as the agent moves (unknowingly) towards a piece of
junk. Each new perceived event <code>junk(X,Y,S)</code> triggers a goal for the
agent, represented as a term of the form <code>goal(X,Y,S)</code>.
Any new goal is
incorporated into the agent's list of intentions according to the
agent's prioritization strategy (see below). The agent then selects
one action for execution from the current list of intentions (here the
agent always selects the first intention on the list if there is one,
creates or modifies the associated plan if necessary, then selects the
first action in that plan, removes the selected action from the chosen
plan, executes the action, and updates the list of intentions by
removing any successfully achieved goals. If there are no current
intentions, the agent simply moves to any adjacent location.

<p>

The agent's prioritization strategy is very simple: without reordering
existing goals, each new goal is inserted into the list of intentions
in order of value (higher values before lower values), but if the new
goal has the same value as existing goal(s), the new goal is inserted
into the list of goals of the same value in order of distance from the
current position (closer before further away). This means the agent
maintains a "commitment" to pursuing its goals (the agent only
changes its intention to pick up a higher value item or a closer item
with the same value).

<h4>Assignment [12 marks]</h4>
<p>
You are supplied with a Prolog program in a file gridworld.pro that
implements the experimental setup, including the generation of events
(appearance of junk) and the execution of actions, and the agent's BDI
interpretation cycle and observation functions.
<p>
[1 mark] Write a Prolog procedure <code>trigger(Events, Goals)</code>
which takes a
list of events, each of the form <code>junk(X,Y,S)</code>, and computes the
corresponding list of goals for the agent, each of the form
<code>goal(X,Y,S)</code>. This is a very simple procedure!
<p>
[4 marks] Write a Prolog procedure<br>
<code>incorporate_goals(Goals, Beliefs, Intentions, Intentions1)</code><br>
which has four arguments: a list of goals
each of the form <code>goal(X,Y,S)</code>, a list of beliefs
(containing one term of the form <code>at(X,Y)</code>),

the current list of intentions each of the form
<code>[goal(X,Y,S), Plan]</code>,
and a list to be computed which contains the new goals inserted into
the current list of intentions in decreasing order of value, using the
distance from the agent to break ties. More precisely, a new goal
should be placed immediately before the first goal in the list that
has a lower value or which has an equal value and is further away from
the agent's current position, without reordering the current list of
goals. Note that because of repeated perception of the same event,
only new goals should be inserted into the list of intentions. The
plan associated with each new goal should be the empty plan
(represented as the empty list).
<p>
[3 marks] Write a Prolog procedure<br>
<code>select_action(Beliefs, Intentions, Intentions1, Action)</code><br>
which takes the agent's beliefs (a singleton list
containing a term for the agent's location) and the list of
intentions, and computes an action to be taken by the agent and the
updated list of intentions. The intention selected by the agent is the
first on the list of intentions (if any). If the first action in this
plan is applicable, the agent selects this action and updates the plan
to remove the selected action. If there is no associated plan
(i.e. the plan is the empty list) or the first action in the plan for
the first intention is not applicable in the current state, the agent
constructs a new plan to go from its current position to the goal
state and pick up the junk there (this plan will be a list of move
actions followed by an pick up action), selects the first action in
this new plan, and updates the list of intentions to incorporate the
new plan (minus the selected first action). Due to the fact that there
are no obstacles in the world, the exact path the agent takes towards
the goal does not matter, so choose any convenient way of implementing
this procedure. The procedure applicable is defined in
<code><a href="./gridworld.pro">gridworld.pro</a></code>
<p>
[1 mark] Write two Prolog procedures<br>
<code>update_beliefs(Observation, Beliefs, Beliefs1)</code> and<br>
<code>update_intentions(Observation, Intentions, Intentions1)</code><br>
to compute the lists of beliefs and intentions
resulting from the agent's observations. These are very simple
procedures (one line for each possible observation type)!
<p>
There are 3 marks allocated for comments and programming style.
